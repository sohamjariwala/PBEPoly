# Population balance-based rheological constitutive model
This program solves a population balanced based constitutive model for
describing the shear rheology of aggregating colloidal suspensions. The
equations are solved using method of moments with interpolative closure (MOMIC).

## Model equations
The model solves the following equations for simple shear flows and determines
the time-dependent stress and structural response.

* Population balance equation
* Viscoelastic stress equation
* Back stress equation
